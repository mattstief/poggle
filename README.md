completely novel take on digital pochinko  
Made with the Godot game engine.  
Running the exe might work. If it does not, it is possible to run the project through the Godot engine. It can be found on Steam.  
I'm eventually hoping to make it run on HTML5. That way, it could be played in-browser, since nobody wants to download and run a random .exe.
